# friday25


- What was the challenge?

- To complete several queries in SQL responding to shop tables and data, pulling out the required information for each query. Alongside making an ERD to show the relationships between the data.


- How I expected the challenge to go.

- Fairly difficult as I struggle with writing new queries even though it makes sense once explained.


- What went well?

- Once i got the understanding and code to make one work, the other 4 seemed to come together quickly.


- What didn't go as planned?

- The time it took to complete the challenge whilst fitting around calls and working from home.


- Possible improvements for future challenges

- More work on the Thursday we are given the challenge so its fresh and prep can be done. Not enough preperation for Friday morning this week.
